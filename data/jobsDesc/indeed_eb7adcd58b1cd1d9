We're fixing this by building software that automates and streamlines the process.\n\n\nWe're profitable and growing sustainably. We're the most popular way for high-growth technology startups to incorporate. Y Combinator and other top accelerators use our software to handle their investment paperwork. Our product is used by tons of top tier startups and investors.\n\n\nWe're a quiet leader in the legal technology space - if you are interested in changing the legal industry, this is arguably the best place to be.\n\n\nNotes on our stack and process:\n\nOur backend is mostly in Ruby on Rails, with very small amounts of Scala and Go as well.\nOur front-end is mostly in Ember.\nWe use CI extensively for linting, tests, visual diffs, and deployment.\nWe're not religious about any particular technology - we believe in using the right tool for a given problem.\n\nThis is a great fit if you want to work:\n\n... at a product-driven company bringing an old-fashioned industry into the future\n\n... on a complex product, with a ton of engineering challenges\n\n... on a well-loved product with a lot of usage and visibility in the startup community\n\n... in a company that strongly values good software development practices\n\n... at a financially sound company\n\n... with bright people who are extremely passionate about their work\n\n... where you'll be a key early software engineer\n\nAs a junior software engineer at Clerky, you will:\n\nMaintain and add features to our Middleman and Gitbook sites\n\nMaintain our builds and continuous integration setups\n\nInvestigate bugs and sporadic test failures\n\nImplement features and fix bugs in our main application\n\nWork with top-notch senior engineers (all of us have 10+ years experience)\n\nFirm requirements:\n\nStrong ability to learn on your own. You will receive some mentorship and guidance from our senior software engineers, but you should expect to learn mostly on your own.\n\nDiscipline and patience to write clean code and use best practices. We are unlike most startups and write code to last - we do not rapidly iterate on prototypes.\n\nThis position is 100% remote. We are happy to support an H-1B visa application after 2 years of employment.","jtr_source":"indeed"}
