(SMI) is a world leader in the design and manufacture of Micro Electro-Mechanical Systems (“MEMS”) that lie at the heart of the advanced sensing market, enabling devices in the medical, industrial, digital con sumer, security, and automotive sectors.\n\nThe company has established itself as a premier provider of MEMS-based pressure sensors for a range of markets, supplying advanced high and low-pressure sensor products that meet the stringent requirements for indu stry and consumer safety. Silicon Microstructures’ design, production and quality control processes have enabled it to develop both the smallest and smartest pressure sensors available today. SMI offers a wide range of pressure sensors, including uncompens ated sensors, temperature compensated and calibrated products as well as sensor systems consisting of an ASIC paired with a sensor die in a custom package.\n\nSUMMARY OF POSITION\n\nAn essential job function of the MEMS product/test engineer is the implementat ion and improvement of systems to monitor, organize and report production data of packaged MEMS pressure sensor devices at the production and test facility of SMI in Milpitas. These MEMS pressure sensor devices are mainly sensor systems consisting of an SM I pressure sensor die and a signal-conditioning ASIC in an SMI custom package. He/she will be responsible for supporting the production test of packaged pressure sensor devices by improving and maintaining the test programs and tester hardware of the curre nt production processes. The MEMS product/test engineer will also be involved in software and hardware improvements of existing testers as well as the development of testers and software for the testing of new pressure sensor products.\n\nESSENTIAL FUNCTIONS\n\nImplement and improve systems to monitor production data and create regular reports concerning yield and process control parameters (i.e. SPC).\nImplement and improve organization of the data storage of the production test systems.\nDrive the effort to establish a new storage system (i.e. based on the STDF format).\nInterface with operations and engineering in case of test, process or product issues.\nEvaluate and implement sensor systems calibration schemes.\nLead test time and cost re duction efforts.\nSupport QA/FA.\nImprove packaged parts test systems (hardware and software) to ensure and increase productivity in a fast paced production environment.\nSupport development of new test systems (software and hardware) for MEMS pressure senso rs.\nSupport and monitor test systems at assembly and test subcontractors abroad.\nSupport production by evaluating problem lots and by defining corrective actions to improve production processes.\nSupport sensor system product releases from first bench top tests to production test.\nServe as product engineer for newly released pressure sensor systems.\nWork cross-functionally.\n\nThe engineer plays an active role in quality improvement in the framework of SMI’s TS16949 quality management system.\n\nEducation, Skills and Experience\n\nRequired:\nA BS degree in Electrical Engineering is required.\n3 to 5 years of related working experience are required.\nExperience in working with production test systems and process control.\nData analysis skills (theoretical skills, as well as software skills).\nBasic programming knowledge.\nSelf-learning attitude.\nExperience working in cross-functional teams is required.\nExperience with semiconductor, sensor and/or MEMS testing is required.\nAbi lity to draft, publish and present test results and conclusions in customer-ready reports.\nThe product/test engineer is expected to be a self-starter, self-motivator with the ability to work effectively in a team environment.\nDesired:\nMS degree is desired.\nBasic LabVIEW skills\nExperience with STDF test data format.\nExperience with test automation is desired.\nBasic knowledge of sensor calibration processes and signal-conditioning ASICs.\nExperience with data base implementation.\nHands-on experience with benc h top setups as well as “rack and stack” test systems.\n\n","jtr_source":"indeed"}
