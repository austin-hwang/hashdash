GeneLab is a jointly sponsored project by the International Space Station Research Integration Office (ISSRIO) at the Johnson Space Center (JSC) and the Human Exploration and Operation Mission Directorate's (HEOMD) Space Life and Physical Sciences Division (SLPSD). It is designed to conduct space bioscience experiments, produce \"omics\" (e.g., genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics, etc.) data, and leverage the value of large omics data, made available from molecular networks and translational research experiments, conducted onboard the ISS and other flight opportunities. The GeneLab project is both a science collaboration initiative, to maximize the omics data collected from spaceflight and from ground simulations of microgravity and radiation experiments, and a data system effort to establish a public bioinformatics repository and collaborative analysis software platform. The goal of this project is to build a data system on top of open sourced bioinformatics software platform for researchers to access and use biologically-inspired spaceflight data as part of \"Open Data, Open Science\" initiative. The software platform will provide capabilities to make these data sets available, citable, discoverable, interpretable, reusable, and reproducible. The candidate in expected to contribute to the on-going development efforts and support operations on existing software platform, using full lifecycle software development best practices.
