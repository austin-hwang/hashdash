Leading a broad coalition of campaign partners, we secured support of Measure AA from 70 percent of Bay Area voters. In recent years, we’ve also won local and state bans on single-use plastic shopping bags, secured tough restrictions on trash pollution entering the Bay, engaged thousands of local residents in hands-on habitat restoration to benefit fish and wildlife, and established Bay Day, a region-wide holiday that both celebrates San Francisco Bay and generates significant exposure for Save The Bay and our mission.\n\nPosition Description:\nWe seek a full-time Philanthropy & Communications Assistant to execute various administrative, fundraising and communications activities in a fast-paced and top-notch advocacy organization.
